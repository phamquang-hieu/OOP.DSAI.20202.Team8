-----------------------------------------------Welcome to our application----------------------------------------------

**Note: because the main purpose of visualization is to help user understand how the algorithm works,
we put some restriction to our application:
  1. Only non-negative numbers (>0) are accepted
  2. The array size is between 5 and 8 (5 <= array's size <=8)


Option menu (on the left of the screen):
* You can:
  - Choose to either:

    + Randomize input with predefined array size. 
      The array have to be entered in comma separated form (eg: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
 
	+ Input your own array in the text field at the bottom of the screen
	
  - Choose your visualize form: node form or bar form (if available)

Control bar (at the bottom of the screen):
* From left to right:
  - A text field to input your array
  
  - A "run" button: 
	if you choose randomize mode -> the array will be automatically created
	otherwise you have to input in the text field array before.
		 
  - A "<<" reset button: go back to your first view.
  
  - A "<" back button: go back to previous view.
  
  - A ">" next button: go to next step.
  
  - A ">>" skip button: to go to the last view (array is sorted).
  
  - An "Auto" button: to automatically run the visualization animation.
  
  - A text area to display the instant step of the algorithm.
